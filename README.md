- Teacher can retrieve a list of students common to a given list of teachers.
- Teacher can suspend a specified student.
- Teacher can retrieve a list of students who can receive a given notification.

## Approach

### Technologies

- Choose a library or framework to develop APIs.
- There are many options for this such as ExpressJS, NestJS, etc.

### Generate source structure

- Depend on requirement or project scope, choose a template or structure for this project.
- There are many options such as 3-layers architecture, module architecture, etc.

### Choose a development method

- Think about TDD (Test-driven development) or TLD (Test-Last development).

### Develop APIs and unit test

- Following the requirements, develop APIs to implement features.
- Write unit test to verify apis.

### More ideas

- Implement security with authentication, authorization.
- Tracing with log.
- Deploy app.

## Tech stacks

- **Backend Framework**: NestJS
- **Database**: MySQL with TypeORM
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Code Formatting and Linting**: ESLint, Prettier

## How to run

### Pre-requisites

- Node.js v20.18.1
- Docker
- Postman

### Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thienduc7218/dev-assessment.git
cd dev-assessment
```

### Environment setup

To run this project, you will need to set up the following environment variables. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in folder `dev-assessment`.

```plaintext
API_PREFIX=api
PORT=3333

MYSQL_DATABASE=server
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=user123
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root123

DOCKER_MYSQL_HOST=mysql
```

### Run docker compose

At folder `dev-assessment`, to build, start and run services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Seeding

After the server is successfully up and running, you can proceed with running the seeding process.

```
docker exec -it my-backend npm run seed:run
```

## Development

### Database Migrations

To run migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate:latest
```

### Seeding

To run for seeding:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### Start application

```bash
npm run start
npm run start:dev
```

### Run test with coverage

```bash
npm run test
```

## Production

### Build application

```bash
npm run build
```

## How to test

### Using Swagger UI (Recommend)

Access to Swagger UI through [localhost:3333/api-doc](http://localhost:3333/api-doc)

## Note

- Following the requirement, I didn't create the API for registering a specific teacher or a specific student. Please run the seeding first to generate data.
